# sp_CheckSecurity

`sp_CheckSecurity` checks a SQL Server instance for several dozen possible security vulnerabilities and returns an ordered list of findings with explanations and action items. It is part of the free [Straight Path IT Solutions](https://straightpathsql.com/) `sp_Check*` suite.

## Features

- Audits **privileged access**: members of the sysadmin and securityadmin roles, logins with CONTROL SERVER, IMPERSONATE ANY LOGIN, and ALTER ANY LOGIN, and (optionally) members of the local Administrators group.
- Checks **login and password risks**: an enabled or renamed `sa` account, blank passwords, passwords matching the login, the password "password", and invalid Windows logins.
- Reviews **service account exposure**: SQL Server and SQL Agent services running as a built-in elevated account or as a member of the sysadmin role, and service accounts in the local Administrators group.
- Flags **risky instance configurations**: `xp_cmdshell`, CLR, OLE Automation Procedures, cross-database ownership chaining, Ad Hoc Distributed Queries, Database Mail XPs, remote admin connections, remote access, C2 audit mode, common criteria compliance, and contained database authentication.
- Reviews **Configuration Manager settings**: Hide Instance, Extended Protection, and Force Encryption.
- Checks **database-level risks**: TRUSTWORTHY databases, db_owner and unusual database role membership, roles within roles, orphaned users, database owner problems, contained databases, and explicit permissions granted to the public role.
- Reviews **surface area and connectivity**: linked servers by security context, startup stored procedures and jobs, running SQL Server Audits, endpoints owned by users, and SQL Agent jobs owned by users.
- Checks **encryption and recoverability**: TDE and backup certificates that have never been backed up, not backed up recently, or set to expire.
- Checks **auditing and patching**: whether failed logins are audited, recent failed logins, error log retention, missing security updates, and unsupported versions.
- Collects **instance discovery information** and supports filtering to only high-importance findings.

## Requirements

- **SQL Server version:** Designed for **SQL Server 2016 (13.x) or later**. It runs on **SQL Server 2012 (11.x)** and **2014 (12.x)** but skips a few checks; on SQL Server 2008 R2 or older it only prints a message and exits (unless `@Override = 1` is used to bypass the version gate). Version-gated checks include:
  - Database-backup-certificate checks and the public-role-permissions check require **SQL Server 2014 (12.x)+** (`>= 12`).
  - The contained-database check requires **SQL Server 2012 (11.x)+** (`>= 11`).
  - The CLR remediation guidance changes on **SQL Server 2017 (14.x)+**.
  - Version and security-update checks skip Azure SQL Managed Instance (`EngineEdition` 8).
- **Permissions:** The executing user **must be a member of the sysadmin role**; the procedure aborts otherwise. It reads server and database metadata, the registry (`xp_instance_regread`), the SQL Server error log (`sp_readerrorlog`), runs `sp_validatelogins`, and queries across databases with `sp_MSforeachdb`.
- **Database count guard:** Instances with **more than 50 databases** require `@Override = 1`, since gathering backup history can be resource-intensive.
- **`@CheckLocalAdmin` warning:** When set to `1`, if `BUILTIN\Administrators` is not already a login, the procedure adds it inside an explicit transaction, reads its members with `xp_logininfo`, and then rolls the transaction back to remove it. Be aware of this if you have triggers or auditing that track login creation.
- **Companion script:** `sp_CheckSecurity_supplemental.ps1` is an optional PowerShell script that collects host-level checks T-SQL cannot reach (Windows firewall status, local Administrators members, and the SQL Browser and CEIP service status) and writes them to a CSV.

## Parameters

| Name | Data Type | Default | Description |
|------|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `@Mode` | `TINYINT` | `99` | Output mode. `0` = all discovered vulnerabilities; `1` = only high-importance items; `99` = information plus all discovered vulnerabilities (default). |
| `@CheckLocalAdmin` | `BIT` | `0` | `1` = check (and record) the members of the local Administrators group; `0` = do not (default). See the warning in Requirements. |
| `@PreferredDBOwner` | `NVARCHAR(255)` | `NULL` | The login you prefer to own your databases. When supplied, databases not owned by this login (system databases not owned by sa) are flagged (CheckID 327). |
| `@Override` | `BIT` | `0` | Set to `1` to proceed on instances with more than 50 databases, and to bypass the unsupported-version gate. |
| `@Help` | `BIT` | `0` | Print help text (purpose, parameters, license) and exit. |
| `@VersionCheck` | `BIT` | `0` | Return the procedure's version number and date, then exit. |

This procedure has no `OUTPUT` parameters.

## Usage

```sql
-- Default run: instance information plus all discovered vulnerabilities
EXEC dbo.sp_CheckSecurity;

-- Only high-importance vulnerabilities
EXEC dbo.sp_CheckSecurity
      @Mode = 1;

-- Include local Administrators membership and flag databases not owned by a preferred login
EXEC dbo.sp_CheckSecurity
      @CheckLocalAdmin = 1
    , @PreferredDBOwner = N'sa';
```

## Priority System

Every finding is assigned a priority (the `Importance` column):

| Priority | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| 0 | Informational |
| 1 | High |
| 2 | Medium |
| 3 | Low |

## Checks

Findings are returned in modes `0`, `1`, and `99`. CheckIDs are grouped into series by category (`2xx` = Recoverability, `3xx` = Security, `4xx` = Availability, `6xx` = Reliability). Series `1xx` is Discovery (instance information shown in mode `99`, not vulnerability findings).

## Results Organization

CheckID series map to categories: **1xx Discovery**, **2xx Recoverability**, **3xx Security**, **4xx Availability**, **6xx Reliability**. The procedure returns a single result set whose rows depend on `@Mode`:

- **High-importance findings** (mode `1`): only findings with Importance 1 (High).
- **All vulnerabilities** (mode `0`): all findings with Importance greater than 0 (excludes the informational discovery rows).
- **Information and all vulnerabilities** (mode `99`): all rows, including the Discovery (1xx) instance information (capture date, server name, instance name, version, edition, build, SQL Server and SQL Agent service accounts, and IP address).

In every mode the result set is ordered by Importance, then CheckName, DatabaseName, and Details. Columns: `Importance`, `CheckName`, `Issue`, `DatabaseName`, `Details`, `ActionStep`, `ReadMoreURL`, `CheckID`.
